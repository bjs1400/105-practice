                <div class="why">
                    <h2>Why become a developer?</h2>
                    <h4>Don't do it unless it makes you excited to get up in the morning.</h4>
                    <p>Why do you code? Why do you want to be a developer or a designer or whatever it is you want to do? Is it because
                        you love it? Far too often in life we have to do things we don't want. When we're young, it's school. Then...well, 
                        I'm not sure because I'm still in school, but my point is: don't make your life harder than it has to be. We have no control
                        over so many of the annoying things we have to do in life, but the one thing we do have control over is what we do for a living.
                        And I don't know about you, but I choose to do something that I want to do. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Use Your Knowledge for Good</h4>
                    <p>Remember that you have to ability to reach millions of people with your talents. Add something positive to the world.
                        Contribute to projects that you resonate with and work with clients whose values align with yours. Figure out what
                        you want to add to the world and achieve it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Never Stop Following Your Dreams</h2>
                    <h4>It's Never Too Late to Start Living Your Dream Life</h4>
                    <p>Everything that you want out of life is already there for the taking. All you have to do to be what you want or have
                        what you want is to think positive so that your vibes match up to what you want to achieve. Whatever it is your 
                       heart desires already exists and is waiting for you to come and take it. Love and respect yourself enough to 
                       go after what you want. <strong>You are worth it.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Believe that anything is possible</h4>
                    <p>Take away your doubtss and everything telling you that you're 
                    doomed to a life of working a 9-5 job, paying bills, and dying. Whatever you want to achieve is within reach and whatever
                you want out of life is possible.</p>
                    <p>Have a growth mindset. As a developer, and in life in general, it's always a good thing to have a love of
                        learning. But you may not always pick things up right away or as fast as other people. Don't let this discourage
                        you! Just because one method of learning doesn't work for you doesn't mean you will never get it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Make <em>"yet"</em> your best friend. Don't say: <em>"I don't know it."</em> Say: "I haven't learned it <em>yet</em>".</p>
                <div class="care">    
                    <h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>
                    <h4>Don't forget to follow these steps to live a productive life as a Developer:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For every hour you spend sitting down, get 15 minutes of exercise. Even if it's just walking in circles
                            in your backyard.
                        </li>
                        <li>Replace junk food snacks like cookies and chips with fruit, nuts, and seeds. Yum! And much healthier!</li>
                        <li>Make time for fun; life is meant to be fun! If you can't have fun, what are you even doing?!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Finally Some General Life Advice</h2>
                    <h4>Life is a journey, not a destination.</h4>
                    <p>It's nice to have goals to work towards, but if you're not happy with your life now, you will likely never be.
                        Instead of living with the mentality of needing to be this or go there or make this much money to be happy,
                        be thankful for everything you have <em>right now.</em> Gratitude will do great things for your life.
